I'll analyze this facility location problem systematically using the available tools. Let me start by understanding the cost structure and then work through to find the optimal solution.

## Step 1: Analyze Cost Structure
## Step 2: Evaluate Different Scenarios

Based on the analysis, let me evaluate some promising scenarios:
Let me try a two-facility scenario:
Let me also check the scenario with all facilities:
## Step 3: Find Optimal Solution

I'll systematically analyze this facility location problem to find the optimal solution. Let me start by understanding the cost structure and trade-offs.
Now let me evaluate promising scenarios based on the cost analysis. The analysis suggests facilities 2, 0, and 1 are most cost-efficient. Let me evaluate a few key scenarios:
Now let me run the MIP optimization to find the truly optimal solution:
Interesting! The optimization found a better solution using 4 facilities (0"
